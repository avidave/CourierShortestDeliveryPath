# CourierShortestDeliveryPath

This program takes in any number of valid locations as input and produces a link that draws a route on Google Maps, should a courier want to deliver packages to every
location while travelling the shortest distance. It uses the Google Maps Distance Matrix and Address Validation APIs to get the location data (including distance between
all locations).

This program is written in Java, and is a Maven project. It uses a Gson dependency to convert java objects to JSON and vice versa.
